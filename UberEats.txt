There is not much that must be changed in this program to implement UberEats. 
The Users (Drivers and Customers) in the program are essentially the same; the 
Drivers simply carry cargo that is slightly different. Although there was little
use for it in the regular implementation of Uber, the Enum type Delivery seen 
here makes the transition to UberEats quite simple. Using this Enum type allows
the user to specify what kind of delivery is being made--in UberEats, this 
delivery is food, and in the regular Uber implementation, the delivery is 
passengers. This makes it easy to see that the functionality around these 
deliveries should not change very much--the Requests still contain source and 
destination locations, for example, the Meter can still keep track of the 
distance between locations to calculate the cost of delivering food to a customer,
and the Drivers still must follow the procedure of traveling from their starting
points, to an alternate starting point (to pick up the food in the case of 
UberEats), and to a final destination (to the customer's house). The rest of the
program is likely to follow in a similar way.
